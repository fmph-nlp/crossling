# xling_embeddings: Simple Cross-Lingual Word Representations #

This repository contains the code and data introduced in:
"A Strong Baseline for Learning Cross-Lingual Word Embeddings from Sentence Alignments"
Omer Levy, Anders SÃ¸gaard, and Yoav Goldberg. EACL 2017.

To get started, download the repository and run *install.sh*. This will also download some multi-lingual corpora to your directory.


Finally, if you would like to replicate the results from the paper, use *evaluate.sh*. You can also modify the script that generated it (*generate_run_all.py*) to evaluate on any other type of embedding.
