<s snum=1> This commitment is important because the Commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and , therefore , basically dictates this Parliament ' s political and legislative activity for the next five years . </s>
<s snum=2> This is the last time that we shall make allowances for Members who have forgotten their cards . </s>
<s snum=3> As you know , like Mr Rack , I come from a transit country , where this issue plays a particularly important role . </s>
<s snum=4> In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently , the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves . </s>
<s snum=5> We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality . </s>
<s snum=6> It is the young people who are disappearing , who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas , all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas . </s>
<s snum=7> Mr President , Commissioner , I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report , which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work . </s>
<s snum=8> The first is the fundamental , central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion . </s>
<s snum=9> I actually quoted the text itself , in quotation marks . </s>
<s snum=10> This can largely be attributed to the structural funds , even_though the disparity between the poorest and wealthiest regions is still considerable . </s>
<s snum=11> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission ' s White Paper on modernisation of the European competition rules has ignited intense and lively debate amongst interested members of the public . </s>
<s snum=12> The reactions from experts and persons affected range from complete rejection to unconditional support . </s>
<s snum=13> This being the case , there are considerable disparities between states , which may be measured in various ways , such as , for_example , as a percentage of added value and per wage earner . </s>
<s snum=14> The Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market . </s>
<s snum=15> We consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it . </s>
<s snum=16> However , we must be vigilant in the face of global operators , against whom nation-states are no_longer able to impose limits . </s>
<s snum=17> Forty years on , this proposal has again been placed on the table and I am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies , to the detriment of Europe ' s consumers . </s>
<s snum=18> Having said all that , I must say that unfortunately , my group will not be voting for your report as a united front . </s>
<s snum=19> With this text we are undoubtedly forcing the issue , since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for Community fraud to be curbed , to be crushed . </s>
<s snum=20> As a Member of the European Parliament for the constituency of Leinster , I have always supported the need for the implementation of bottom-up schemes supported by national EU funds . </s>
<s snum=21> I think that given the dramatic circumstances , and as a matter of principle , it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several votes . </s>
<s snum=22> I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity . This programme must work at full capacity . </s>
<s snum=23> This situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself . </s>
<s snum=24> The establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it , 2002 in fact . </s>
<s snum=25> The European_Commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the NATO action . </s>
<s snum=26> I can not answer that question . </s>
<s snum=27> The question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Holiness , the Dalai Lama ' s , proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair ? </s>
<s snum=28> This limited training element has , however , been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times . </s>
<s snum=29> Funding for NGO programmes in Tajikistan amounted to EUR 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999 . </s>
<s snum=30> I am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them . </s>
<s snum=31> The Lisbon European Council is trying to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society , economic policy and reforms . </s>
<s snum=32> It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it . </s>
<s snum=33> Again , I can assure you that , as such , you have picked up on one of the Commission ' s reform objectives . </s>
<s snum=34> This is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable , not just to this House , but more generally to the European public . </s>
<s snum=35> Lasting peace in the region can only be achieved by means of an agreement which guarantees the security of the Israeli borders , as_well_as Syria ' s integrity . </s>
<s snum=36> Mr President , Commissioner Patten , the recent peace talks begun in the USA between Israel and Syria mark a turning point in the history of the Middle East . </s>
<s snum=37> However , I would remind him that , during his inaugural debate , he described the Commission as a European government . </s>
<s snum=38> We were also outraged , however , at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny , the terror and the excesses of the former USSR . </s>
<s snum=39> Surely it is the values and principles of freedom , democracy and respect for human rights , more than anything . </s>
<s snum=40> Have you stopped to ask whether_or_not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here ? </s>
<s snum=41> However , it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle . </s>
<s snum=42> Thank you , Commissioner . </s>
<s snum=43> We should no_longer be worried that the agenda for the IGC will be restricted . </s>
<s snum=44> What we need are visible rights for each and every citizen ; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the Union . </s>
<s snum=45> Article 56 of the Treaty , prohibiting currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital , must be removed so that damaging currency speculation may be checked by means of political control . </s>
<s snum=46> It should also be noted that of the 19 departments , 4 already have administrative leadership , which represents an improvement on the situation there hitherto . </s>
<s snum=47> These are events and situations that can not be tolerated . </s>
<s snum=48> Well in simple economic terms , Europe ' s culture adds to genuine prosperity . </s>
<s snum=49> I do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive . </s>
<s snum=50> This is my main concern in this matter . </s>
<s snum=51> Consequently , for end-of-life vehicles we propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end-of-life vehicles in_order_to safeguard the principle of freedom from costs . </s>
<s snum=52> Parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context . </s>
<s snum=53> This is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes . </s>
<s snum=54> I consider that this is a serious defect and that , in principle , it does not befit our legal system . </s>
<s snum=55> The elections to the European Parliament in 1999 showed perfectly clearly that the people of Europe do not fall in with the notion of an ever more federalist EU centred upon Brussels . </s>
<s snum=56> I have clearly received your series of messages on this subject and I believe that Mrs Banotti has an answer for you . </s>
<s snum=57> I believe that this is a serious issue which we are obliged to follow up , but it should not be dealt with by means of urgent procedure . </s>
<s snum=58> This is the kind of good practice we would like to see extended across the EU in terms of communication and publicity . </s>
<s snum=59> The measures eligible for funding listed in Annex II of strand A do also seem encouraging in this respect . </s>
<s snum=60> Some areas within the European Union are economically very strong and heavily exceed the average income per_capita . </s>
<s snum=61> Consequently , we can not support Amendment No_2 of the Greens , as borne out in the committee meeting . </s>
<s snum=62> The fact is , showing solidarity with Eastern Europe , is all very well , but it is not enough . </s>
<s snum=63> Like the rapporteur , we deplore the fact that it has been excluded from strand IIIA . </s>
<s snum=64> Finally , a word on INTERREG . </s>
<s snum=65> That is my initial response to the threshold question . </s>
<s snum=66> These will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years . </s>
<s snum=67> The time has come to discuss , and then establish , a body for emergency civil protection in Europe . </s>
<s snum=68> But we also say : we want to defend this European Community of tolerance , which is why a common foreign , security and defence policy is so important . </s>
<s snum=69> We must not allow the critics of European integration to claim , as they presently do with some justification as we have just heard from Mr Bonde , that the increase in EU responsibilities is a one-way street only . </s>
<s snum=70> Europe , which is so democratic , so progressive , does not speak out or take these tragic problems on board , while half of Africa is dying of Aids and other diseases . </s>
<s snum=71> There is no future for a Union which is merely a geo-strategic concept or for a Union which is merely a free trade zone . </s>
<s snum=72> Madam President , in the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party , the most important task of the Commission and the whole Union in the coming years is the successful realisation of enlargement . </s>
<s snum=73> The new Europe should not only expand horizontally , but also vertically , by living by our values in practice and by developing a democratic structure of a real community . </s>
<s snum=74> The governments which , through spinelessness or ideology , support you are also responsible . </s>
<s snum=75> We are and will remain among those fighting against Europeanist dictatorship . We call on all the people of Europe to resist your monstrous projects . </s>
<s snum=76> What sort of impression will an interested public , as_well_as the rest of the world , have of this five-year programme ? </s>
<s snum=77> I concur with what other members of my political group have said and I commend the tone of your document . However , there are two omissions which need to be addressed in our future work . </s>
<s snum=78> Everyone knows that quality of life and full and better employment depend on sustainable economic growth . </s>
<s snum=79> Nearly 40_% of businesses in this survey are still reporting additional costs to render products or services compatible with national specifications . </s>
<s snum=80> It would be a tragedy if their efforts were to be undermined by deficiencies in EU legislation . </s>
<s snum=81> We will be looking at the extent to which we can create an equilateral policy triangle combining economic policy , employment policy and social policy . </s>
<s snum=82> Mr President , I also rise on a point of order . </s>
<s snum=83> I personally believe that it is nothing short_of scandalous that we hear Members of this Parliament attacking the demonstration rather_than looking at the solution to the problem , which is fair conditions , fair pay and fair hours . </s>
<s snum=84> We can never talk enough about the difficulties experienced in the past by maritime and landlocked border regions which have been cut off economically , socially and culturally . </s>
<s snum=85> This is proved by the fact that in the areas where those initiatives were implemented , farming incomes and employment decreased rapidly , which resulted in their depopulation . </s>
<s snum=86> As_of October 1999 the Commission proposed introducing a legal basis into Directive 70 / 524 / EEC for the replacement of the authorisations . </s>
<s snum=87> Cosmetic , medical and other products can not be excluded on the grounds that they cause no harm or are not dangerous . </s>
<s snum=88> I have proposed in the proposal at hand to delete all currently existing Community rules on scrapie in sheep and goats and to transpose them to the framework proposal for a regulation . </s>
<s snum=89> Many directives have already been adopted . Furthermore , the Commission wants to make these directives more understandable and more compatible with each_other and to give them clearer objectives . </s>
<s snum=90> We need to get into that conciliation position . </s>
<s snum=91> Some seven years ago , it still looked like the European water policy was going to be sacrificed on the altar of subsidiarity . </s>
<s snum=92> We can not afford to wait . </s>
<s snum=93> Mr President , I welcome Mr Barnier ' s commitment to go to the regions , both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say . </s>
<s snum=94> Progress is slow due_to the tense relations between the ethnic groups of this divided city . </s>
<s snum=95> I was in Mitrovica a couple of months ago , I saw the situation there for myself . </s>
<s snum=96> During the previous question , we were discussing electoral issues . </s>
<s snum=97> May I thank Mr Andersson for the supplement to his first question and may I answer that question as follows ? </s>
<s snum=98> I gather that Mr Posselt has hinted at the fiscal aspects of this matter . </s>
<s snum=99> I therefore think that regardless_of whether we finally conclude who should decide whether such diversions take place , the specifications common to us all must be very stringent . </s>
<s snum=100> This is also reflected in many of Parliament ' s amendments . </s>
<s snum=101> The Nitrates Directive will not therefore be influenced by the present framework directive . </s>
<s snum=102> Amendment No_71 does not take account of seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of the groundwater . </s>
<s snum=103> Mr President , I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her sensitive approach towards the environment , ably demonstrated in the two reports we have discussed this evening . </s>
<s snum=104> The reality is quite different . </s>
<s snum=105> And therein lies the paradox . </s>
<s snum=106> This also covers persons from third countries and stateless persons . </s>
<s snum=107> The general interest of policy coherence is , therefore , a responsibility of the Commission as a whole , of the Council , and of the European Parliament . </s>
<s snum=108> I particularly wish to stress that a new way of looking at these issues seems to be emerging , especially as regards trade , and it is certainly necessary to tackle this area . </s>
<s snum=109> As with the systems of forces which are studied in basic physics , it makes no sense to implement policies which will cancel each_other out . </s>
<s snum=110> It would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes . </s>
<s snum=111> After all , we are all familiar with the reports from Amnesty International . </s>
<s snum=112> VOTE ( continuation ) </s>
<s snum=113> As a result of the debates on the principle of precaution , traceability , responsibility and transparency , the European_Commission has presented a White Paper on food safety . </s>
<s snum=114> In my belief it is incorrect to use such a crude tool as a common European charge for this issue . </s>
<s snum=115> We have seen a report concerned with water quality in Europe transformed into an instrument of commercial war . </s>
<s snum=116> Next session of UN Human Rights Commission ( continuation ) </s>
<s snum=117> How do we implement what the Treaties say in all those words about development assistance programmes ? </s>
<s snum=118> Is there any procedure for suspending him from office until the judicial investigation into the accusations has been completed ? </s>
<s snum=119> You mentioned before that we are on the brink of catastrophe there and nothing is being done . </s>
<s snum=120> The Kosovo problem is well-known and the international community is present there on a massive scale . </s>
<s snum=121> There is another small step , which is related to the recent partial lifting of the embargo decided by our 15 governments for Yugoslavia . </s>
<s snum=122> It is important that , in time , there should be a more_or_less similar-looking form of protection under criminal law in all countries . </s>
<s snum=123> Thank you , too , those who contributed to this matter ' s being dealt with swiftly . I am thinking in particular of the Group of the Party of European Socialists . </s>
<s snum=124> This means that every Member State must guarantee the establishment of effective , adequate penal sanctions , which act as a deterrent against the offences covered by the draft framework decision . </s>
<s snum=125> We concluded that it is not , but given the importance of the issue we nonetheless agreed to accept this procedure . </s>
<s snum=126> The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed . </s>
<s snum=127> But a number of the amendments go too far in restricting the use of over-the-counter derivatives . </s>
<s snum=128> Master-feeder funds are therefore at variance with the aim of the directive and the Committee on Economic Affairs was right to reject them for this reason . </s>
<s snum=129> Although in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs we were very much in agreement with the aims of the legislative amendment , the debate we had was not the easiest one . </s>
<s snum=130> This condition of accrual is essential since , in my opinion , the principle of nulla poena sine lege , legality in criminal law , must be observed . </s>
<s snum=131> Apart_from that , the Tampere European Council has already indicated in which direction we , in the Commission , should go . </s>
<s snum=132> But the Prodi Commission now wants to transform the EU so that it can apply for joint global governance with the United_States , which it also sees as its future competitor and rival . </s>
<s snum=133> We are well aware of this current economic context and that the purpose of restructuring is to rationalise corporate management . </s>
<s snum=134> At present , we are witnessing a number of large mergers between companies which originate in an Anglo-Saxon tradition and companies with a Rhineland tradition . </s>
<s snum=135> This is true of the disgraceful events which have recently occurred in El Ejido . </s>
<s snum=136> What happened at El Ejido is the result of inadmissible racist and xenophobic practices in Europe today . </s>
<s snum=137> Their only crime was to criticise what human rights organisations have been denouncing all along , namely the large-scale corruption and disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars , paid by the oil companies to the Angolan Government . </s>
<s snum=138> Native Americans in the US - Dineh </s>
<s snum=139> There are few of them left and they are up against a very powerful , economic adversary . </s>
<s snum=140> I became convinced of this in Sarajevo when I had to negotiate the periodic exchanges of prisoners which accompanied each successive ceasefire agreement , none of which unfortunately lasted , between the parties to the conflict . </s>
<s snum=141> The question is , therefore : what are the demands that a monopoly or part of a service which is governed by a monopoly needs to meet ? </s>
<s snum=142> So liberalisation has taken a_lot_of parasites off our back in many areas and enabled many people to enjoy higher standards of living . </s>
<s snum=143> They have referred to rural and sparsely populated areas . </s>
<s snum=144> In the world of networking , the mail service is the most democratic of all networks . </s>
<s snum=145> They are extremely highly qualified , of a calibre which it is difficult , if not impossible , to find in the individual national administrations because_of the nature of the recruitment methods and criteria used . </s>
<s snum=146> ( The Commissioner indicated that he would speak later ) Very well , thank you . </s>
<s snum=147> People may have to risk their lives in Kosovo , but that is the price of freedom at the moment . </s>
<s snum=148> For six months now , owing_to sordid ambitions of power , the Russian administration has been conducting a dirty colonial war , piling on more dreadful atrocities every day . </s>
<s snum=149> This request , however , was not honoured by the Council at its Helsinki Summit at the end of last year . </s>
<s snum=150> My second question is different , although it is not unconnected with the previous one . </s>
<s snum=151> Mr Solana can play an important role in this . </s>
<s snum=152> Prime_ministers , members of parliament , ministers , in the professional arena , doctors , lawyers , pilots , generals . </s>
<s snum=153> The difficulty lies in finding the right solution to allow women to have a greater presence in positions of responsibility and therefore in decision making . </s>
<s snum=154> It could hardly have been made more abundantly clear , what we are concerned with here . </s>
<s snum=155> Today , we are focusing upon the ways in which more women might be able to participate in the decision-making process . </s>
<s snum=156> And we should say so very clearly , it will involve more savings on services , more third systems , more reductions in average working hours , whatever methods we adopt to achieve these things . </s>
<s snum=157> Thirdly , we fully agree that it is necessary to reform labour relations in Europe , but that clearly means for us that we must protect and enrich the human capital . </s>
<s snum=158> Some of the data is also irrelevant such as that referring to the taxation of enterprises . </s>
<s snum=159> 80 percent of it was landed by purse seine . </s>
<s snum=160> We can not , and must not , stand idly by in the face of this . </s>
<s snum=161> The polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate . </s>
<s snum=162> The French Government has initiated a discussion and made proposals to strengthen maritime safety , particularly by fighting against the phenomenon of flags of convenience and by implementing much more extensive inspection . </s>
<s snum=163> Nor would I like our oral question to be perceived as an indictment . </s>
<s snum=164> We have chosen to abstain in the vote on Amendment 4 to the Katiforis report on the EU Economy ( 1999 ) . </s>
<s snum=165> Can we really achieve that full employment without unleashing that entrepreneurial talent ? </s>
<s snum=166> Europe needs to achieve full employment . </s>
<s snum=167> Thank you , Commissioner . </s>
<s snum=168> There was nonetheless a whole raft of amendments at first reading which has been completely endorsed by Parliament . </s>
<s snum=169> The only difference of opinion is over how best to achieve this goal . </s>
<s snum=170> We must also be under no illusions , Mr President of the Commission , as_to the fact that we must get straight down to work on these criteria and the core tasks I mentioned . </s>
<s snum=171> Last month , Mr Prodi talked of a radical decentralisation of the Union ' s activities . </s>
<s snum=172> We should no_longer have to sit in the committee rooms looking at the students from the Permanent Representations , in possession of documents to which we ourselves have no access . </s>
<s snum=173> Improved living conditions , employment and the quality of employment will continue to be intimately linked to our ability to make European research more dynamic . </s>
<s snum=174> In particular , we will be looking for evidence that each new proposal has been properly tested against the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and we will be looking for sector-specific debates in the European Parliament's own specialised committees . </s>
<s snum=175> This guiding principle is mainly the protection of the Community ' s financial interests . </s>
<s snum=176> We agree with you that we need a rules-based trading system . </s>
<s snum=177> That is a very good example , but what happened to the other five ? </s>
<s snum=178> We wanted the Commission to draft an amendment proposal , if_need_be . </s>
<s snum=179> I therefore urge you to support Amendments Nos 29 and 18 . </s>
<s snum=180> Nor is it certain that the Third World , all_in_all , would benefit from other vegetable fats being prohibited as added ingredients . </s>
<s snum=181> This is what the consumer wants . </s>
<s snum=182> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to express my total agreement with the speech that Mr Queiró has just made on this subject , and to introduce another element into the discussion . </s>
<s snum=183> Our resolution does not say much with regard to content , but Parliament has already had , on at_least three occasions , the opportunity to state what it expected from a charter on fundamental rights . </s>
<s snum=184> We would like the Intergovernmental Conference , which is just starting , to keep the essential principle of respect for national democracies continually in mind . </s>
<s snum=185> As we are all aware , from the European Parliament ' s perspective , this should represent a step towards the constitutionalisation of the Union . </s>
<s snum=186> We also belong to a party that was forged in the struggle for democracy , and one of whose greatest concerns has always been the steadfast promotion of human rights . </s>
<s snum=187> Furthermore , our group hopes that a written European catalogue of fundamental rights will put European integration on a firmer legal-ethical footing and help to create greater transparency and clarity for the citizens . </s>
<s snum=188> What I was not clear about was when he talked about other measures where it was necessary to make the single market work . </s>
<s snum=189> I would like to hear your views on the matter , Commissioner : do you intend to take action for the economic , ecological and cultural restoration of the areas which were damaged ? </s>
<s snum=190> Commissioner , I am convinced that the Committee on Budgets will be delighted to read this information as soon as they are provided with it . </s>
<s snum=191> Since you have asked , the state which has opposed it until_now is France . </s>
<s snum=192> The EU is at present adopting legislation to promote mobility and road safety . </s>
